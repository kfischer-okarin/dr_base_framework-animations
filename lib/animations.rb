# Provides a simple functional style animation system.
#
# In the simplest case, a frame is a hash of values to be set on the target and a
# duration:
#
#   animation = Animations.build(
#     frames: [
#       { tile_x: 0, tile_y: 0, duration: 5 },
#       { tile_x: 32, tile_y: 0, duration: 5 }
#     ]
#   )
#
# It can then be started via ::start! on a target (e.g. a sprite):
#
#   sprite = { x: 100, y: 100, w: 32, h: 32, tile_w: 32, tile_h: 32, path: 'resources/character.png' }
#   animation_state = Animations.start! sprite, animation: animation
#
# and every tick you need to call ::perform_tick to advance the animation:
#
#   Animations.perform_tick animation_state
#
# By default the animation will stay on a frame until the duration is reached,
# then immediately move to the next frame but you can also specify an easing
# function to gradually interpolate between frames:
#
#   animation = Animations.build(
#     frames: [
#       { x: 0, y: 0, duration: 5, easing: :linear },
#       { x: 100, tile_y: 100, duration: 5, easing: :linear }
#     ]
#   )

    # the current values of the target and the values in the +to+ hash.

    #
    #             This value is required except for the last frame
    #             of a non-repeating animation.
    #
    # [:metadata] A hash of metadata that is available via
    #             ::current_frame_metadata when the frame is active.
    #
    # [:easing] The easing function to use when interpolating between
    #           the current and next frame.
    #
    #           Check out the EASING_FUNCTIONS constant for a list of
    #           available easing functions.
